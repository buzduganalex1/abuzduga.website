## About me 

I love life and appreciate all it has to offer. 
I strongly believe in one's process and I think structure and order produce the best intelectual results.
Since I first started in the computer science field, I loved to study and discover a lot about the 'unknown' and in the end i finished with a bachelor and masters degree in Computer Science at [Alexandru Ioan Cuza University](https://www.info.uaic.ro/en/home-page-2/)
After I continued to work and learn and noticed that when I start to focus on a problem it is hard to stop until i am happy with the results I get. 
The most difficult problems I managed to solve, most of the time I did through diligence and perseverence, in the end somehow I manage to find a solution :D.

I learned that you have to :
- Constantly learn, work and thrive.
- Make use of the little time you have to progress a little more.
- Organize your work in such a way that you are efficient and produce the best results as fast as possible

In the end I am happy with the chances I got and hope to get more and I plan to continue following my own way to become a better me.
